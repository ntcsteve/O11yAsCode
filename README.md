# DevRel Workshop - O11y As Code - Terraform

Observability as code is a term used to describe the process of automating the configuration of your observability tools, in a consistent, controlled, and automated way, to help you derive maximum value from your telemetry data. Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts.

In this DevRel workshop, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Googleâ€™s Site Reliability Engineering book.
